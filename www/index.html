<h2>Welcome to Broken Record!</h2>
<p>When people are sad, angry, scared, or nervous, we tend to get trapped in what we're going to call broken record thinking.
We repeat the same negative things over and over to ourselves.  Tell the app what is bothering you, going around and around in your head.
When the record appears, type in positive things to break out of your broken record thinking.</p>
