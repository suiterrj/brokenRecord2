<h3>Have you been outside today?</h3>
<p>Try going hiking, a walk in the park, even going to your mail box.</p>
<h3>Have you talked with someone today?</h3>
<p>Call a loved one, send a quick email, say hi to someone on the street.</p>
<h3>Are you taking care of yourself?</h3>
<p>Make sure you get time to relax, try to avoid alcohol and drugs, make sure you're eating healthy and getting enough sleep.</p>
<h3>Need someone to talk to?</h3>
<p>Find a support group, either friends, families, or other people who are going through the same thing.</p>
<h3>Remember: You are not alone, you are not broken, you can get through this</h3>
