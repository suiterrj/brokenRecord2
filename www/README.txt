Broken Record
Creatos: Rebecca Suiter, Kelsey Mason, Elyce Longnaker

Broken Record is an app designed to help people with PTSD break out of cycles of negative thinking.
The app prompts the user to enter the negative thought cycling through their mind. They can then
enter positive statements, which crack the record until it breaks.  The app also includes some
resources and helpful information for people with PTSD.

In the future, we would like to connect Broken Record to IBM's Watson Pesonality Insights.
We could use this to analyze user input for positivity and overall changes in tone. If a user is
entering increasingly negative statements, the app could preemptively offer resources, or promp
them to see a therapist. We would also like the app to remember statements made, in order to
offer users positive feedback or encouragement based off of tone analysis or repeated patterns.

This app in its current state runs off of PhoneGap. To run the app, first download the PhoneGap
Desktop Application. Then clone the git repository onto your computer. Open PhoneGap on your
computer, and click the plus sign in the top left corner to open an existing PhoneGap project.
Select the folder you put the repository in. Run the application. Download the PhoneGap app
on a mobile device, and connect to the address given by the Desktop application to run the app.
